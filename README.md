C# files for database interaction

Purpose is to generate a fully functional relational database interface in C# for the purposes of account, password and
character relation, as well as full inventory and statistical persistence. All files uploaded here will only function on my
localhost for the time being, but could easily be modified to work on some hosted server. For testing and ease-of-use
purposes, this is currently implemented as a Windows Form Application, but will eventually be wrapped into a custom API.
